Abstract convergence schemes are basic category-theoretic structures that serve as universes for studying infinite evolution-like processes and their limiting behavior. Convergence schemes carrying possibly an extra structure provide an applicable framework for studying both discrete and continuous processes as well as their random variants.
The main goal of the project is to unify and extend several concepts from model theory, algebra, topology, and analysis that are related to generic structures.
We propose studying selected topics within the framework of abstract convergence schemes, addressing questions of their complexity and classification.	
One of our inspirations is the theory of universal homogeneous models, where convergence of finite structures is involved. Another motivation stems from the set-theoretic forcing, where a convergence scheme is simply a partially ordered set of approximations of certain *unreachable objects*, living outside of the universe of set theory.
